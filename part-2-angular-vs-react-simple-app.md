# What are we going to build? 
First idea: A simple marketing app that has a landing page and a form to collect interest in a product.
## Things to compare between the two tools
- common building blocks
    - Angular: @Module, @Component, @Input, @Output
    - React: ???
- routing

## Demo or live code and copy paste pre-canned solutions to show how it gets put together.
- Create new app with `angular-cli` and `react-starter-app`
- Add routing to landing page and form collection page
- Show usage and explain what common building blocks are
    - maybe go into explaining what a typescript decorator (annotation) function is and explain how angualr uses them
