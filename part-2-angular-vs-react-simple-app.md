# What is Angular Today?
Angularâ€™s framework approach is to keep most of the magic under the hood, providing tooling and best practices on top. Angular encourages you to use components, splitting your UI into separated and reusbale pieces.

## Angular written TypeScript
## Angular is organized with Components
## Angular encourages DRY seperation of concerns

1. Show a re-usable hero landing page component (DRY / reuse)
    - default - full image, centered text and button
    - full image, right text button
    - full image, left text and button
2. Show how to fetch data into an injectable service (seperation of concerns)
3. Routing to multiple pages 
    - landing page
    - contributors page
    - contributors detail page

# What are we going to build? 
First idea: A simple marketing app that has a landing page and a form to collect interest in a product.
## Things to compare between the two tools
- common building blocks
    - Angular: @Module, @Component, @Input, @Output
    - React: ???
- routing

## Demo or live code and copy paste pre-canned solutions to show how it gets put together.
- Create new app with `angular-cli` and `react-starter-app`
- Add routing to landing page and form collection page
- Show usage and explain what common building blocks are
    - maybe go into explaining what a typescript decorator (annotation) function is and explain how angualr uses them
